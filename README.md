# 🚗 Car Price Prediction 💰

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting car prices based on various features such as year, present price, selling price, fuel type, and more. 📊

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `car data.csv`, which includes the following features:
- 🚘 **Car Name**
- 📅 **Year** (Manufacturing year)
- 💰 **Present Price** (Current ex-showroom price in INR)
- 💵 **Selling Price** (Price at which the car is sold)
- ⛽ **Fuel Type** (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- ⚙️ **Transmission** (Manual/Automatic)
- 👤 **Owner** (Number of previous owners)

## 📂 Project Files

- 📜 `CarPrice_prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- 📁 `car data.csv` - Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding data patterns through visualizations.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Creating new relevant features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training** - Implementing regression models such as:
   - Linear Regression
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Optimizing models to enhance predictive accuracy.
6. **Model Evaluation** - Measuring performance using:
   - R² Score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
7. **Prediction & Insights** - Using the trained model to predict car prices based on input features.

## ⚙️ Installation & Requirements

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
## 🎯 Results

The trained model predicts car prices with high accuracy. 🌟
- Feature importance analysis provides insights into key factors affecting car prices.
- Visualizations help understand the data distribution and model performance.
